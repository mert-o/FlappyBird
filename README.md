## Flappy Bird but not.


### Setup (Tested on MacOS and Ubuntu)

- git clone https://github.com/mert-o/flappybird.git  
- cd flappym  
- conda create --name \<name\> python=3.8.*  
- conda actiave \<name\>  
- pip install -r requirements (Requires cmake)  
- python flappy.py  


### New:  
- Difficulty levels.  
- Now the game asks for calibration after 5 seconds of not seeing a face.  
- Two modes are combined; pipes and stars.  


### Fix:  
- Smile is not very eye dependent now.  


### Notes:  
Effects are not working right now, will do it with media pipe.
